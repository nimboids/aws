"aws" is a command line program that accesses Amazon Web Services:

EC2
S3
SQS
SDB
ELB
IAM

To run "aws", all you need is a single file! Download https://raw.github.com/nimboids/aws/master/aws, make it executable, and you are done.

This version has been customised from the original timkay version, so that it supports Eucalyptus (Ubuntu cloud).

Add the following into your ~/.awsrc file:
--http
--no_vhost

The script will pick up the correct environment variables (assuming you've run your eucarc file, or equivalent)

For more documentation, see http://timkay.com/aws/

If you can help improve the "aws" documentation, please let me know.
